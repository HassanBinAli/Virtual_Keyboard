# Virtual_Keyboard
The key focus of this project is to make a keyboard that can be operated at a distance from laptop/PC using laptop's/PC's camera.

This project is made in Opencv library.
In this project, camera of laptop/PC is used to detect the hand of the user.
when the index finger / middle finger hovers on any key of keyboard, the color of that specific key changes.
the distance between the index finger and middle finger is measured, if it is less than a threshold value, the key is pressed and the character is shown on screen.
